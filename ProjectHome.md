Level Four (L4) is a free and open source visual analytics platform. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and integrated toolset to transform raw data into visual scenarios and stories.

The project is based on three components:

L4TK : data visualization toolkit

  * Models: data structures
  * Methods: filters and manipulation of data structures
  * Views: visual representation of data structures
  * Controls: interactivity
  * Presentation: publishing analytical results as stills, animations, and interactive mediums

L4AE : visual analysis environment

  * A node-based procedural modeling system for designing a data visualization pipeline
  * A scenegraph-based management system for controlling the visual variables of data objects
  * A rendering system for the exploration of data worlds
  * An animation and event management system for creating interactive scenes and story representations

L4G : a common grammar and design pattern approach for creating complex recipes

  * A standard approach to describe representations influenced by Leland Wilkinson's The Grammar of Graphics
  * A design pattern approach for "plug-ins" to evolve the platform
  * A provenance approach for sharing analytical pipelines for collaboration
