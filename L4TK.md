### Introduction ###

L4TK is the visualization engine for L4AE. The tookkit provides the needed functions and methods for encoding data to visual representations. The project is based on development and the integration/adoption of related open source libraries (see attributions).

### Details ###

A node-based compositing architecture provides the means to create procedural visualization pipelines based on task needs. Node-based compositing represents an scene as a set of linked nodes to create "logic chains" from raw data to visual rendering.

Focus areas include:

  * Relational Analysis: methods for the analysis of relational data sets such as social networks, organization trees, navigation systems, taxonomies, db schemas, and other link-based phenomena.
  * Geospatial Analysis: rendering of vector and raster-based maps with control and functions to facilitate analysis of geospatial data.
  * Quantitative Analysis: conventional and novel approaches to the analysis of numerical data.
  * Temporal Analysis: functionality for time-series, timeline, and chronological data analysis.

L4AE employs a node-based interface for compositing with L4TK.
